# Python-Speech-Recognition-System

This project implements an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system using Python. It converts spoken language to text through acoustic modeling, enabling various applications such as voice commands, transcription, and voice-controlled interfaces. Additionally, it integrates text-to-speech conversion using pyttsx3 library to enhance user interactions with synthesized speech.

## Introduction

Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have gained significant popularity due to their ability to convert spoken language into text, enabling hands-free interactions and accessibility features. This project aims to develop a Python-based ASR system using the speech recognition library for accurate transcription of spoken words, along with text-to-speech capabilities provided by pyttsx3 for natural interaction.

## Features

1. **Speech Recognition**: Convert spoken language into text using acoustic modeling and pattern recognition techniques.
2. **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: Synthesize speech from text using pyttsx3 library for natural-sounding interactions.
3. **Voice Commands**: Implement voice-controlled commands for various tasks, such as controlling devices, searching the web, or executing scripts.
4. **Transcription**: Transcribe spoken audio files into textual format, suitable for applications like meeting minutes, lecture notes, etc.
5. **Interactive Interface**: Enhance user interactions by providing synthesized speech responses to user inputs.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- speech_recognition library
- pyaudio library
- pyttsx3 library

## Usage

To use this ASR system:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
3. Follow the instructions provided in the documentation to set up the system and configure input/output devices.
4. Run the Python scripts to perform speech recognition or text-to-speech conversion tasks.
5. Customize the system according to your specific requirements or integrate it into other projects.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the ASR system:

```python
# Example code for speech recognition
import speech_recognition as sr

# Initialize the recognizer
recognizer = sr.Recognizer()

# Capture audio from the microphone
with sr.Microphone() as source:
    print("Listening...")
    audio = recognizer.listen(source)

# Recognize speech using Google Speech Recognition
try:
    print("You said: " + recognizer.recognize_google(audio))
except sr.UnknownValueError:
    print("Sorry, could not understand audio.")
except sr.RequestError as e:
    print("Could not request results from Google Speech Recognition service; {0}".format(e))
